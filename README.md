# Pyrogram userbot

## Host locally
1. Create virtual environment and install requirements from `requirements.txt`.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Put API_ID and API_HASH in `.env`. Get API ID and hash from [here](https://my.telegram.org/auth) by creating an application if haven't already created.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen and run the userbot.

```python
    python3 main.py
```
